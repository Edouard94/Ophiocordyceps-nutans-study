# Disentangling Ophiocordyceps nutans complex through Museomics

This repository contains data and analysis scripts for the scientific study on the Ophiocordyceps nutans species complex using museomics approaches.

## Overview

Ophiocordyceps nutans is an entomopathogenic fungus that infects insects. This study uses museomics (genomic analysis of museum specimens) to investigate the species boundaries and phylogenetic relationships within the O. nutans complex.
